# The One Project: A project to rule them all

_One Project_ is mainly designed to manage recursivelly a collection of git repos.

## Get-stated:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imt-mobisyst/oneProject
oneProject/bin/instal.sh

```

We recommand to source your `run-commands` in your favorit shell.

`bash` for instance:

```bash
echo """
# Ring
export RING_HOME=~/Ring
source \$RING_HOME/run-commands.bash
""" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
